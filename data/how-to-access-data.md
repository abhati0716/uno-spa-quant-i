### Accessing data

#### From the web
In the command window, write:
```
ssc install bcuse
bcuse wage1
```
The first line installs the ```bcuse``` command (you only need to do this part once) and the second line opens the ```wage1``` dataset.

Any data set can be accessed via the ```bcuse``` command with a complete listing of datasets found [here](http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/wooldridge/datasets.list.html).
